# Pokémon Legends
Welcome to Pokémon Legends! Here, you will get to experience a simple Pokemon game, with references to the official Pokémon game battles and some of their systems. All feedbacks regarding the game for improvements are welcome!

## Context
Pokémon Legends is a game project done during my education, where I will utilize what I learnt in my lectures about Vue, Express and MongoDB to develop a reactive frontend frameworks and RESTful API.

# Note

The primary purpose of this website is to let players play the Pokémon Legends game, on both PC and mobile. This game mainly targets Pokémon fans and gamers in general.

## Owner Stories
```
- As the developer of the game, I want to create a user-friendly and fun game so that my players will enjoy their time in the game.
- As the developer of the game, I want to ensure that the game remains as close to a Pokémon game as possible, so that fans of the Pokémon games have a sense of familiarity and reminiscence with us.
```

## User Stories (Players & Visitors)
```
- As a player, I want to find a good Pokémon game so that I can spend some of my free time on the game as a source of entertainment.
